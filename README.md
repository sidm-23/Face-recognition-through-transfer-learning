# Face-recognition-through-transfer-learning
Dataset on which I worked on 5 Celebrity Faces Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/5-celebrity-faces-dataset) then added some of my photos to expand the dataset. Then I used 'haar cascade classifier' for face detection and finally trained the data by adding 2 custom layers on top of MobileNetV2 CNN
